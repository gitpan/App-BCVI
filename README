App-BCVI

This distribution provides the 'bcvi' utility which works with SSH to
provide a 'back channel' from the SSH server back to your workstation.
Messages sent over the back channel can initiate a number of tasks
including invoking a GUI editor on your workstation and instructing it
to open a file on the server.  A number of back channel commands are
available 'out of the box' and you can write plugins to add more.


INSTALLATION

The 'bcvi' program is a standalone script with no companion modules and
no non-core dependencies.  To install it, simply copy the bin/bcvi file
from the distribution to a directory in your search PATH.  Alternatively,
you can use the standard CPAN installation procedure to install the
script to /usr/local/bin:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

The backchannel protocol requires a client and a server - the 'bcvi' script
performs both roles.  The server runs on your workstation and is typically
launched by adding this command to your X session startup:

    bcvi --listener

When connecting to a server you will want to use this command to wrap the
SSH command and add the required port forwarding options:

    bcvi --wrap-ssh -- hostname

It is probably more convenient to set up an alias so that this happens on
every SSH connection.  Use this command to add the appropriate aliases to
your bash startup scripts:

    bcvi --add-aliases

Now that you have the server set up and ssh connection wrapping in place,
you need to install 'bcvi' on the machine you will ssh to:

    bcvi --install HOSTNAME

Now that the installation is complete, when you log in to the machine
using SSH, a number of shell aliases will be available to you:

    vi
        Invokes gvim on your workstation, passing it an scp://... URL 
        of the file(s) you wish to edit

    suvi
        Same as above, but uses sudoedit so system files (requiring
        root access) can be edited too

    bcp
        Copies the named file back to your workstation desktop
